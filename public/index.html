      <p>
        my name is andrew yurovchak. i currently reside in hoboken nj, where am a student studying computer science at stevens institute of technology, set to graduate in may 2026.
      </p>
      <p>
        i enjoy learning new programming languages and creating new things. i have a portfolio of side projects i have made over the span of a couple years, in which i have made a point of doing interesting/useful things with interesting technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        last summer, i interned as a software engineer at jacobs technology, where i worked on c# applications that loaded navigational data onto military aircraft. this year, i am the head of development & risk at the stevens student managed investment fund, where i lead a team of 5 developers working on tools for the rest of the fund.
      </p>
      <p>
        i am currently open to opportunities for the summer of 2025. you can view my resume below.

      <hgroup>
        <h1 id="my-projects-header">my projects</h1>
        <p>here are a couple of projects i am really proud of:</p>
      </hgroup>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>collab-notepad</b>: i wrote an online collaborative text editor in elixir and svelte, for which i wrote and tested my own conflict resolution algorithm that prevented edit conflicts. the result of this is that editors can pull changes from the server without pushing, and vice versa. <span> <a href="https://github.com/andrewyur/collab-notepad">github repository</a> </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>qart</b>: i figured out how to make russ cox's qart codes, and wrote a rust command line application that makes them. i published this as a crate on crates.io, which has close to 1000 downloads. <span> <a href="https://github.com/andrewyur/qart">github repository</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/qart">crate</a> </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>md-sticky</b>: i found myself disliking the editor of the default sticky notes app that comes with macos, and rather than pay for one i liked i decided to make my own with tauri (rust & svelte). it is now something i use daily, while i iron out bugs as i find them. <span> <a href="https://github.com/andrewyur/md-sticky">github repository</a> </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
